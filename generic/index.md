# Generic Statements templates

These statements pull together common statements that are the building blocks of recipes. 

The process in using these generic statement templates:

1. Add ticket explaining which recipe you want to add and which statements will make it up
2. Create a feature-branch from the current master branch or dev branch for you to work in
3. Copy the generic statement/s to the correct recipe or new recipe if required.
4. Update copied generic statement with required vocabulary and information
5. Add new vocabulary to the vocabulary page
6. Update copied generic recipe with specific examples for each of the statement properties
7. If a statement needs changing, check if it is already in the common statements page, otherwise create a new one
8 Descriptions of statement can be removed from the template once in the commin statements page
9. Once completed update ticket for discussion at next team meeting and make a pull request
