# Generic Statements templates

These statements pull together common statements that may be resused in different circumstances. 

The process in using these generic statement templates:

- Add ticket explaining the process
- Create a feature-branch from the current master branch or dev branch
- Copy the generic statement/s to the correct recipe or new recipe if required.
- Update copied generic statement with specific vocabulary
- Add new vocab to the vocabulary page
- Update copied generic recipe with specific examples for each of the statement properties
- If a statement needs changing, check if it is already in the common statements page, otherwise create a new one
- Descriptions of statement can be removed from the template once in the commin statements page
- Once completed update ticket for discussion at next team meeting
