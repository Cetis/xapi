#intervention Recipe
Revision: 0.1 

## Purpose
This activity records a service creating an intervention for a person.

## Draft Notes
In this draft the actor is the service, the object is the person the intervention is sent to, and the context describes the intervention activity. 

An alternative draft could cast the agent as the person the intervention is sent to, the object describes the intervention activity and the context the system? But the person is passive in this recipe?
